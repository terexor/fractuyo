Now it's a library for generating electronic invoices with JavaScript. This library follows ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª Sunat's regulations on invoices.
When items are added, receipt amounts are calculated.
It doesn't contain anything visual so it doesn't generate a PDF file for printing either.
## What do you need?
To generate a document you only need the data.
To sign the document you will need a digital certificate and the private key.
## What documents can you generate?
### Invoice
This is the main document. Two types can be represented: _factura_ and _boleta de venta_.
### Note
Two types can be generated: _credit note_ and _debit note_.
